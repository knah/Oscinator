# Oscinator
This is a simple tool to view and modify avatar parameters exposed by VRChat via OSC/OSCQuery. 
Theoretically compatible with other applications using a similar OSC interface.

Usage: run it alongside VRChat, use the Parameters tab to modify parameters.
If using with VRChat on a Quest or a phone, select the appropriate network adapter from the list in "General" tab â€” not that such usage was tested.
Make sure to allow Oscinator in Windows Firewall if networked (non-local) usage is desired.

### Building
You'll need [.NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0) or later.  
Use `dotnet run -c Release --project Oscinator` to run from sources.  
Use `dotnet publish --sc -r linux-x64 -c Release Oscinator` to build a self-contained binary in `Oscinator/bin/Release/net9.0/linux-x64/publish`. Use `win-x64` on Windows.  

### Acknowledgements
